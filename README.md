##Client

###Installation / Updating
Option a) Extract the DarkMultiPlayer zip to GameData.  
Option b) Download DMPUpdater, place the program next to KSP.exe (Or KSP.app/KSP.x86_64), and run it.  

You can download both options from http://dmp.52k.de/w/Download

####LINUX BUG
The linux version of KSP ships with a bugged libpng, which can be disabled by hex editing the executable.  
  
Make sure the sha256 sum is correct, these instructions are specifically for 0.24.2  

    sha256sum KSP.x86_64

Patch the executable  

    echo "0099f587: 00" | xxd -r - KSP.x86_64
    echo "0099f58c: 00" | xxd -r - KSP.x86_64

Check it patched correctly:  

    sha256sum KSP.x86_64

###Connecting to a server
The connection window will appear on the main menu. Type in a username, press add server, type in the details, and then hit add.  
A player token will be generated (At GameData/DarkMultiPlayer/Plugins/Data/token.txt) during the first DMP start. DMP registers your username to the server with this token. If you lose your token, you will no longer be able to connect to the server with that username until the server admin deletes you from Universe/Players/.  
  
###Connecting, If you are also running a server
If you are running the server locally, you will want to connect to 127.0.0.1/localhost.  
If you are running the server on a networked computer, you will most likely be connecting to a 10.x.x.x or 192.168.x.x address.  
Do not type in your public IP, this usually refers to your modem, which won't be running the DMP server (Unless you have the public IP address in your computer, which is rare).  
  

###Flag sharing
DMP will sync any flags under the GameData/DarkMultiPlayer/Flags folder - Put your local flags in here if you want other players to see them. All other flags will work in any location if all players have the flags installed, but it will get reset to default if a player gets near a vessel with a flag they do not have.
  
###Chat window
By default, you will join the Global channel (and cannot leave it).  
To PM a player, type /query playername or click on their player name in the global chat.  
To start a group chat, type /join groupname.  
To leave a PM or group chat, type /part or /leave in the window you want to leave. You can also press the 'Leave' button.  
Group chats are indicated by the '#' mark, player chats are indicated by the '@' mark.  
Newlines can be entered in the chat window with shift+enter.  
  
###Craft sharing window
To upload a craft, press on your user name and then click 'Upload'.  
To download a craft, press on the owning player's username and select one of their uploaded vessels.  
  
###Screenshot sharing window
To upload a screenshot, press 'Upload'.  
To view a players screenshot, press on their player name.  
If the server has screenshot saving enabled, The players name will go red when there is a new screenshot to view.  
  
###Mods
If you try to connect to a modded server, DMP will tell you everything you are missing, and tell you everything you shouldn't have in order to connect. If there is any DLL's that need to be added, you will need to restart KSP.  
  
###Warping
Both regular and phyiscs warp are available. When you warp, you will be put into your own "time" (called a subspace) which other players can sync to. All updates from the past affect future players, but future players will not affect players in the past.

##Mods
Read DMPModControl.txt, it's commented/documented. The file can be copied from a *development* KMPServer (The one where you can use SHA sums, not the one with the !md5 section) - The file format is the same.  
  
If you are running a private server, it's safe enough to just add the missing parts.  
  
You can get the DMP client to make a DMPModControl.txt file specific for your gamedata directory by pressing Options -> Generate DMPModControl.txt file.
The whitelist option will only allow you to connect with the mods in your gamedata directory.
The blacklist option will allow you to connect with any mods.
